 2. Creational Patterns
	 1. Factory Pattern:  Creating and delivering objects based on incoming parameters. 
		- Simple Factory:
		- Static build method that returns a concrete class that is a subclass of a parent class based on parameters. 
	2. Factory Method:
		- Subclass creates the object but the factory class calls to common functions. 
		- For instance you create a AbstractFactory and then sub classes that inherit from the abstract factory. 
		- leave the object creation to the subclasses and  
	- Car::build(carName)
		- Sedan
		- Hatchback 
	
3. Structural Patterns
	 1. Facade Pattern 
		- A way of providing a simple clear interface to a complex system. 
	 2. Adapter Pattern
		- A way of providing a interface for an external API (interface and then call the methods on the interface)
	 3. Decorator Pattern https://github.com/samsam-026/Design_Patterns/tree/master/src/structural/decorator
	- Basically you create a new class which implements the method of the main class and then calls and 


**Command Pattern: https://github.com/samsam-026/Design_Patterns/tree/master/src/behavioral/command**

Observer Pattern: calls when a state changes
**Observer** is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

Model notifications in laravel such as create update delete.

Singleton Pattern: if 1 object should be created for a class.
